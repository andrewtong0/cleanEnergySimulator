Simple simulation of creating an energy farm

Simple non-scientific energy simulation game made for a STEM talk for kids.

### Controls
* 1 - Select solar panels
* 2 - Select wind turbines
* 3 - Select water dams
* LMB - Place selected object
* N - Reset scene
* SPACE - Run simulation

### How it works
Based on calculations from various online sources, each clean energy source was assigned a kWh value. Solar panels = 1kWh/day, wind turbines = 16438 kWh/day, water dams 38356 kWh/day. The display in the top left shows how much energy has been produced since beginning the simulation, and the kWh/day reading shows how much energy is produced each day. The day counter in the top right shows how many days have passed in the simulation.

### Why
A simple project made for a STEM talk I did for students in 2018. Thought it would be a fun way to show the power of technology and how we can use it to help exploration in clean energy.
